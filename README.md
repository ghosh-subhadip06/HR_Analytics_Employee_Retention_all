# HR Analysis: Employee Retention

# Introduction:<br>
This dashboard is designed to analyse employee retention and identify the key factors driving the high attrition rate. It provides insights into workforce trends, helping stakeholders understand employee behaviour and support data-driven decisions to improve retention strategies.

# Purpose:<br>
This project focuses on employee retention by analyzing the key reasons behind a high employee attrition rate of approximately 50%. Using data visualization tools such as Power BI and Tableau, the analysis identifies and highlights the major factors contributing to attrition across departments, educational qualification of employees and their gender groups. The insights generated from this analysis help organizations better understand attrition patterns and support data-driven strategies to address the root causes and improve employee retention. 

# Features:<br>
⚪ Average Attrition rate for all departments, gender and employees with different educational background.<br>
⚪ Average Hourly rate of employees from different departments, different educational background and gender. <br>
⚪ Attrition rate vs monthly income stats. <br>
⚪ Attrition rate vs average working years for each Department. <br>
⚪ Job Role Vs Work life balance. <br>
⚪ Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation. <br>

# Conclusions:
<div>
<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> Total employees ~ 50,000, with about 50% active; gender distribution is almost equal across all groups.
</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> Attrition rate is around 50% for both male and female employees, with minimal variation by department, job role, or education.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> Six departments exist; R&D has the highest attrition (51%) and Hardware the lowest (49%), but differences are small.
</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span>Average working years, hourly rates, and performance ratings show no major impact on attrition.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span>Attrition does not change significantly across income levels or marital status.
</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span>Freshers and experienced employees show similar attrition rates. Promotions, salary hikes, and past work experience do not strongly influence attrition.
</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span>Work–life balance and office environment appear consistent and do not explain the high attrition.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span>Higher attrition is observed among employees with over 35 years of experience in certain departments and roles under specific managers, which requires attention.
</div>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> Overall, attrition patterns are largely uniform, and no single strong factor clearly explains the high attrition rate.</div>


# Recommendations:

<div>
<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> HR shows ~88% attrition among employees with over 35 years under the same manager, and Software also has high senior attrition—indicating the need for a manager-level review. </p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> Run employee feedback surveys/exit interviews to capture qualitative reasons for attrition that are not visible in quantitative data.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:30px; line-height:0; margin-right:10px;">⚪</span> Perform deeper analysis on workload and team culture, as standard parameters like salary, performance, work–life balance did not explain turnover.</p>
